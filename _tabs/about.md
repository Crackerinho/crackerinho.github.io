# 👋 Hi, I’m Enrik

I’m a cybersecurity practitioner focused on **offensive security, automation, and red team operations**.

This site is my technical journal — where I document labs, tooling, and workflows used in penetration testing and adversary simulation.

Everything here is built through **practice, experimentation, and continuous learning**.

---

## 🛡️ Areas of Focus

### 🔴 Offensive Security
- Network & web penetration testing
- Internal & external assessments
- Privilege escalation & lateral movement
- Active Directory attacks
- Post-exploitation workflows

### 🧪 Labs & Practice

Most of my learning happens through practical environments and self-built labs.

I regularly work on:

- TryHackMe and similar training platforms
- Active Directory lab environments
- Pivoting and tunneling scenarios
- Internal network enumeration
- Tool testing and workflow validation

I use these labs to test techniques and improve automation.

## 🚀 Core Projects

### 📌 ATLAS — Automated Target Logging & Scanning
A deterministic reconnaissance and execution engine designed for structured security testing.

**Key features:**
- Tool orchestration via templates
- Rule-based routing
- Reproducible assessments
- Headless operation

---

## 📚 Learning & Training

I actively train through:

- 🏴‍☠️ Capture The Flag (CTF) platforms
- Realistic attack labs

Current focus:
- Active Directory attacks
- Evasion techniques
- Red team infrastructure

> Skill is built in labs — not in theory.
